  "description": "# Innovative UX Designer\n\nCreate distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic \"AI slop\" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices. Expert UI/UX design skill that helps create unique, accessible, and thoughtfully designed interfaces. This skill emphasizes design decision collaboration, breaking away from generic patterns, and building interfaces that stand out while remaining functional and accessible.\n\nThis skill emphasizes **bold creative commitment**, breaking away from generic patterns, and building interfaces that are visually striking and memorable while remaining functional and accessible.\n\n## Core Philosophy\n\n**CRITICAL: Design Thinking Protocol**\n\nBefore coding, **ASK to understand context**, then **COMMIT BOLDLY** to a distinctive direction:\n\n### Questions to Ask First\n1. **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?\n2. **Tone**: What aesthetic extreme fits? (see Tone Options below)\n3. **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)?\n4. **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n### Tone Options (Pick an Extreme)\nChoose a clear aesthetic direction and execute with precision:\n- **Brutally minimal** - stripped to essence, bold typography, vast whitespace\n- **Maximalist chaos** - layered, dense, visually rich, controlled disorder\n- **Retro-futuristic** - vintage meets sci-fi, nostalgic tech aesthetics\n- **Organic/natural** - soft edges, earthy colors, nature-inspired textures\n- **Luxury/refined** - elegant spacing, premium typography, subtle details\n- **Playful/toy-like** - bright colors, rounded shapes, delightful interactions\n- **Editorial/magazine** - strong typography hierarchy, asymmetric layouts\n- **Brutalist/raw** - exposed structure, harsh contrasts, intentionally rough\n- **Art deco/geometric** - bold patterns, metallic accents, symmetric elegance\n- **Soft/pastel** - gentle gradients, muted tones, calming atmosphere\n- **Industrial/utilitarian** - functional, no-nonsense, mechanical precision\n\n### After Getting Context\n- **Commit fully** to the chosen direction - no half measures\n- Present 2-3 alternative approaches with trade-offs\n- Then implement with precision: production-grade, visually striking, memorable\n\n## Foundational Design Principles\n\n### Stand Out From Generic Patterns\n\n**NEVER Use These AI-Generated Aesthetics:**\n- **Fonts**: Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts as primary choice, Space Grotesk (overused by AI)\n- **Colors**: Generic SaaS blue (#3B82F6), purple gradients on white backgrounds\n- **Patterns**: Cookie-cutter layouts, predictable component arrangements\n- **Effects**: Glass morphism, Apple design mimicry, liquid/blob backgrounds\n- **Overall**: Anything that looks \"Claude-generated\" or machine-made\n\n**Instead, Create Atmosphere:**\n- Suggest photography, patterns, textures over flat solid colors\n- Apply gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns\n- Use layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders\n- Consider custom cursors, grain overlays, contextual effects\n- Think beyond typical patterns - you can step off the written path\n\n**Draw Inspiration From:**\n- Modern landing pages (Perplexity, Comet Browser, Dia Browser)\n- Framer templates and their innovative approaches\n- Leading brand design studios\n- Historical design movements (Bauhaus, Otl Aicher, Braun) - but as inspiration, not imitation\n- Beautiful background animations (CSS, SVG) - slow, looping, subtle\n\n**Visual Interest Strategies:**\n- Unique color pairs that aren't typical\n- Animation effects that feel fresh\n- Background patterns that add depth without distraction\n- Typography combinations that create contrast\n- Visual assets that tell a story\n\n### Core Design Philosophy\n\n1. **Simplicity Through Reduction**\n   - Identify the essential purpose and eliminate distractions\n   - Begin with complexity, then deliberately remove until reaching the simplest effective solution\n   - Every element must justify its existence\n\n2. **Material Honesty**\n   - Digital materials have unique properties - embrace them\n   - Buttons communicate affordance through color, spacing, typography, AND shadows when intentional\n   - Cards can use borders, background differentiation, OR dramatic shadows for depth\n   - Animations follow real-world physics principles adapted to digital responsiveness\n\n   **Examples:**\n   - Clickable: Use distinct colors, hover state changes, cursor feedback, subtle lift effects\n   - Containers: Use borders, background shifts, generous padding, OR shadow depth\n   - Hierarchy: Use scale, weight, spacing, AND elevation when it serves the aesthetic\n\n3. **Functional Layering**\n   - Create hierarchy through typography scale, color contrast, and spatial relationships\n   - Layer information conceptually (primary → secondary → tertiary)\n   - Use shadows and gradients INTENTIONALLY when they serve the aesthetic direction\n   - Embrace functional depth: modals over content, dropdowns over UI\n   - Avoid: glass morphism, Apple mimicry (but shadows/gradients are tools, not enemies)\n\n4. **Obsessive Detail**\n   - Consider every pixel, interaction, and transition\n   - Excellence emerges from hundreds of small, intentional decisions\n   - Balance: Details should serve simplicity, not complexity\n   - When detail conflicts with clarity, clarity wins\n\n5. **Coherent Design Language**\n   - Every element should visually communicate its function\n   - Elements should feel part of a unified system\n   - Nothing should feel arbitrary\n\n6. **Invisibility of Technology**\n   - The best technology disappears\n   - Users should focus on content and goals, not on understanding the interface\n\n### What This Means in Practice\n\n**Color Usage:**\n- Base palette: 4-5 neutral shades (backgrounds, borders, text)\n- Accent palette: 1-3 bold colors (CTAs, status, emphasis)\n- Neutrals are slightly desaturated, warm or cool based on brand intent\n- Accents are saturated enough to create clear contrast\n\n**Typography:**\n- Headlines: Emotional, attention-grabbing, UNEXPECTED (personality over pure legibility)\n- Body/UI: Functional, highly legible (clarity over expression)\n- 2-3 typefaces maximum, but make them CHARACTERFUL and distinctive\n- Clear mathematical scale (e.g., 1.25x between sizes)\n- NEVER default to Inter, Roboto, or Space Grotesk - find unique fonts\n\n**Animation:**\n- Purposeful: Guides attention, establishes relationships, provides feedback\n- Subtle: Felt rather than seen (100-300ms for most interactions)\n- Physics-informed: Natural easing, appropriate mass/momentum\n\n**Spacing:**\n- Generous negative space creates clarity and breathing room\n- Mathematical relationships (e.g., 4px base, 8/16/24/32/48px scale)\n- Consistent application creates visual rhythm\n\n### Design Decision Checklist\n\nBefore presenting any design, verify:\n\n1. **Purpose**: Does every element serve a clear function?\n2. **Hierarchy**: Is visual importance aligned with content importance?\n3. **Consistency**: Do similar elements look and behave similarly?\n4. **Accessibility**: Does it meet WCAG AA standards? (contrast, touch targets, keyboard nav)\n5. **Responsiveness**: Does it work on mobile, tablet, desktop?\n6. **Uniqueness**: Does this break from generic SaaS patterns?\n7. **Approval**: Have I asked before implementing colors, fonts, sizes, layouts?\n\n**Design System Framework:**\n\nFor understanding what's fixed (universal rules), project-specific (brand personality), and adaptable (context-dependent) in your design system, think of a design system.\n\n## Visual Design Standards\n\n### Color & Contrast\n\n**Color System Architecture:**\n\nEvery interface needs two color roles:\n\n1. **Base/Neutral Palette (4-5 colors):**\n   - Backgrounds (lightest)\n   - Surface colors (cards, inputs)\n   - Borders and dividers\n   - Text (darkest)\n   - Use slightly desaturated, warm or cool greys based on brand\n\n2. **Accent Palette (1-3 colors):**\n   - Primary action (CTA buttons)\n   - Status indicators (success, warning, error, info)\n   - Focus/hover states\n   - Use saturated colors for clear contrast against neutrals\n\n**Palette Structure Example:**\n```\nNeutrals: slate-50, slate-100, slate-300, slate-700, slate-900\nAccents: teal-500 (primary), amber-500 (warning), red-500 (error)\n```\n\n**Color Application Rules:**\n\n- **Backgrounds**: Lightest neutral (slate-50 or white)\n- **Text**: Darkest neutral for primary text (slate-900), mid-tone for secondary (slate-600)\n- **Buttons (primary)**: Accent color with white text\n- **Buttons (secondary)**: Neutral with border and dark text\n- **Status indicators**: Specific accent (green=success, red=error, amber=warning, blue=info)\n- **Interactive states**:\n  - Hover: Darken by 10-15% or shift hue slightly\n  - Focus: Use ring/outline in accent color\n  - Disabled: Reduce opacity to 40-50% and remove hover effects\n\n**Color Relationships:**\n\nChoose warm or cool intentionally based on brand:\n- **Warm greys** (beige/brown undertones): Organic, approachable, trustworthy\n- **Cool greys** (blue undertones): Modern, tech-forward, professional\n\nAccent colors should have clear contrast with both:\n- Light backgrounds (for buttons on white)\n- Dark text (if used as backgrounds for white text)\n\n**Intentional Color Usage:**\n- Every color must serve a purpose (hierarchy, function, status, or action)\n- Avoid decorative colors that don't communicate meaning\n- Maintain consistency: same color = same meaning throughout\n\n**Accessibility:**\n- Ensure sufficient contrast for color-blind users\n- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA: minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text\n- Don't rely on color alone to convey information (add icons or labels)\n\n**Unique Color Strategy:**\n\nTo stand out from generic patterns:\n- NEVER use default SaaS blue (#3B82F6) or purple gradients on white\n- Use unexpected neutrals: warm greys, soft off-whites, deep charcoals, rich blacks\n- Pair neutrals with distinctive accents: terracotta + charcoal, sage + navy, coral + slate\n- Dominant colors with SHARP accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes\n- Test combinations against \"does this look AI-generated?\" filter\n- Vary between light and dark themes - no design should look the same\n\n**Create Atmosphere with Color:**\n- Gradient meshes for depth and visual interest\n- Noise textures and grain overlays for tactile feel\n- Layered transparencies for dimension\n- Dramatic shadows for emphasis and drama\n\n### Typography Excellence\n\n**Typography Philosophy:**\n\nTypography is a primary design element that conveys personality and hierarchy.\n\n**Functional vs Emotional Typography:**\n- **Headlines/Display**: Prioritize emotion, personality, attention (legibility secondary)\n- **Body Text**: Prioritize legibility, reading comfort, accessibility\n- **UI/Labels**: Prioritize clarity, scannability, consistency\n\n**Font Selection:**\n- Use 2-3 typefaces maximum, but make them UNEXPECTED and characterful\n- Limit to 3 weights per typeface (e.g., Regular 400, Medium 500, Bold 700)\n- Prefer variable fonts for fine-tuned control and performance\n\n**NEVER Use These Fonts as Primary:**\n- Inter (overused by AI and generic SaaS)\n- Roboto (too generic)\n- Arial/Helvetica (default fallback vibes)\n- Space Grotesk (AI generation favorite)\n- System fonts as primary choice (only as fallback)\n\n**Font Version Usage:**\n- **Display version**: Headlines and hero text only - BE BOLD\n- **Text version**: Paragraphs and long-form content - legibility matters\n- **Caption/Micro**: Small UI labels (1-2 lines, non-critical info)\n\n**Find Distinctive Fonts:**\n- Google Fonts for web - but dig deeper than page 1\n- Type foundries for unique options\n- Choose fonts that serve your CHOSEN AESTHETIC DIRECTION\n- Pair distinctive display font with refined body font\n\n**Typographic Scale:**\n\nUse mathematical relationships for size hierarchy:\n- **Ratio**: Major third (1.25x) for moderate contrast, Perfect fourth (1.333x) for dramatic\n- **Base size**: 16px (1rem) for body text\n- **Example scale (1.25x)**:\n  ```\n  xs:   0.64rem (10px)\n  sm:   0.8rem  (13px)\n  base: 1rem    (16px)\n  lg:   1.25rem (20px)\n  xl:   1.563rem (25px)\n  2xl:  1.953rem (31px)\n  3xl:  2.441rem (39px)\n  4xl:  3.052rem (49px)\n  5xl:  3.815rem (61px)\n  ```\n\n**Typographic Hierarchy:**\n- Create clear visual distinction between levels\n- Headlines, subheadings, body, captions should each have distinct size/weight\n- Use combination of size, weight, and color for hierarchy\n\n**Spacing & Readability:**\n- **Line height**: 1.5x font size for body text (e.g., 16px text = 24px line-height)\n- **Line length**: 45-75 characters optimal for readability (60-70 ideal)\n- **Paragraph spacing**: 1-1.5em between paragraphs\n- **Letter spacing (tracking)**:\n  - Larger text (headlines): Slightly tighter (-0.02em to -0.05em)\n  - Normal text (body): Default (0)\n  - Small text (captions): Slightly looser (+0.01em to +0.03em)\n  - General rule: As size increases, reduce tracking; as size decreases, increase tracking\n\n**Font Pairing Logic:**\n\nWhen using multiple typefaces, create contrast through:\n- **Category contrast**: Serif + Sans-serif (classic, clear distinction)\n- **Weight contrast**: Light + Bold (dynamic, energetic)\n- **Personality contrast**: Geometric + Humanist (modern + warm)\n\nExamples:\n- Serif headlines + Sans body (editorial, trustworthy)\n- Display headlines + System body (distinctive + efficient)\n- Bold sans headlines + Light sans body (modern, clean)\n\n**UI Typography:**\n\nSpecific guidance for interface elements:\n- **Button text**: Semi-Bold (600), 14-16px, consistent casing (all-caps OR title case)\n- **Form labels**: Regular (400), 14px, positioned above input\n- **Form input text**: Regular (400), 16px minimum (prevents iOS zoom on focus)\n- **Placeholder text**: Light (300) or desaturated color, same size as input\n- **Error messages**: Regular (400), 12-14px, color-coded (red-ish)\n\n**Responsive Typography:**\n\nScale type sizes across breakpoints:\n```tsx\n// Example with Tailwind\n<h1 className=\"text-3xl md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl\">\n  Responsive Headline\n</h1>\n\n// Or with CSS clamp (fluid)\nh1 {\n  font-size: clamp(2rem, 5vw, 4rem);\n}\n```\n\nReduce sizes on mobile (20-30% smaller than desktop)\nReduce hierarchy levels on small screens (fewer distinct sizes)\n\n### Layout & Spatial Design\n\n**Compositional Balance:**\n- Every screen should feel balanced\n- Pay attention to visual weight and negative space\n- Use generous negative space to focus attention\n- Add sufficient margins and paddings for professional, spacious look\n\n**Grid Discipline:**\n- Maintain consistent underlying grid system\n- Create sense of order while allowing meaningful exceptions\n- Use grid/flex wrappers with `gap` for spacing\n- Prioritize wrappers over direct margins/padding on children\n\n**Spatial Relationships:**\n- Group related elements through proximity, alignment, and shared attributes\n- Use size, color, and spacing to highlight important elements\n- Guide user focus through visual hierarchy\n\n**Attention Guidance:**\n- Design interfaces that guide user attention effectively\n- Avoid cluttered interfaces where elements compete\n- Create clear paths through the content\n\n## Interaction Design\n\n\n**Motion Specification:**\n\nFor detailed motion specs, see MOTION-SPEC.md (easing curves, duration tables, state-specific animations, implementation patterns).\n\n### User Experience Patterns\n\n**Core UX Principles:**\n\n1. **Direct Manipulation**\n   - Users interact directly with content, not through abstract controls\n   - Examples:\n     - Drag & drop to reorder items (not up/down buttons)\n     - Inline editing (click to edit, not separate form)\n     - Sliders for ranges (not numeric input with +/-)\n     - Pinch/zoom gestures on mobile (not +/- buttons)\n\n2. **Immediate Feedback**\n   - Every interaction provides instantaneous visual feedback (within 100ms)\n   - Types of feedback:\n     - **Visual**: Button pressed state, hover effects, color changes\n     - **Haptic**: Vibration on mobile (submit, error, success)\n     - **Audio**: Subtle sounds for critical actions (optional, user-controlled)\n     - **Loading**: Skeleton screens, spinners for >300ms operations\n     - **Success**: Checkmarks, green highlights, toast notifications\n     - **Error**: Red highlights, inline error messages, shake animations\n\n3. **Consistent Behavior**\n   - Similar-looking elements behave similarly\n   - Examples:\n     - **Visual consistency**: All primary buttons have same colors, sizes, hover states\n     - **Behavioral consistency**: All modals close via X button, ESC key, and outside click\n     - **Interaction consistency**: All drag targets have same hover state and drop feedback\n     - **Pattern consistency**: All forms validate on blur and submit\n\n4. **Forgiveness**\n   - Make errors difficult, but recovery easy\n   - **Prevention strategies**:\n     - Disable invalid actions (grey out unavailable buttons)\n     - Validate inputs inline (before submission)\n     - Confirm destructive actions (delete, overwrite)\n     - Auto-save in background (drafts, progress)\n   - **Recovery strategies**:\n     - Undo/redo for all state changes\n     - Soft deletes (trash/archive before permanent delete)\n     - Clear error messages with actionable fixes\n     - Preserve user input on errors (don't clear forms)\n\n5. **Progressive Disclosure**\n   - Reveal details as needed rather than overwhelming users\n   - Levels of disclosure:\n     - **Summary**: Show essential info by default (card title, price, rating)\n     - **Details**: Expand to show more info (description, specs, reviews)\n     - **Advanced**: Hide complex options behind \"Advanced settings\" toggle\n   - Examples:\n     - Accordion: Start collapsed, expand on click\n     - Search filters: Show 3-5 common filters, hide rest behind \"More filters\"\n     - Settings: Basic settings visible, advanced behind \"Show advanced\"\n\n**Modern UX Patterns:**\n\n1. **Conversational Interfaces**\n\n   Prioritize natural language interaction where appropriate:\n\n   **Four types:**\n   - **Pure chat**: Full conversation (AI assistants, support bots)\n   - **Command palette**: Text-based shortcuts (Cmd+K, search everywhere)\n   - **Smart search**: Natural language queries (search \"meetings next week\" vs filtering)\n   - **Form alternatives**: Conversational data collection (\"What's your name?\" vs form fields)\n\n   **When to use:**\n   - Complex searches with multiple variables\n   - Task guidance (wizards, onboarding)\n   - Contextual help\n   - Quick actions (command palette)\n\n   **When NOT to use:**\n   - Simple forms (just use inputs)\n   - Precise control interfaces (design tools, dashboards)\n   - High-frequency repetitive tasks\n\n2. **Adaptive Layouts**\n\n   Respond to user context automatically:\n   - **Time-based**: Dark mode at night, light during day\n   - **Device-based**: Simplified UI on mobile, full features on desktop\n   - **Connection-based**: Reduce images/video on slow connections\n   - **Usage-based**: Prioritize frequent actions, hide rarely-used features\n\n   Examples:\n   - Auto dark/light mode based on time or system preference\n   - Simplified mobile navigation (hamburger menu) vs full desktop nav\n   - Collapsed sidebar on small screens, expanded on large\n\n3. **Bold Visual Expression**\n\n   Aesthetic flexibility based on chosen direction:\n   - Shadows ALLOWED and encouraged when intentional (dramatic shadows, soft elevation)\n   - Gradients ALLOWED for depth, accents, backgrounds, and atmosphere\n   - NO glass morphism effects (this is the one banned technique)\n   - NO Apple design mimicry (find your own voice)\n   - Focus on typography, color, spacing, AND visual effects to create hierarchy\n   - Create atmosphere: gradient meshes, noise textures, grain overlays, dramatic lighting\n\n**Navigation:**\n- Clear structure with intuitive navigation menus\n- Implement breadcrumbs for deep hierarchies (more than 2 levels)\n- Use standard UI patterns to reduce learning curve (hamburger menu, tab bars)\n- Ensure predictable behavior (back button works, links look clickable)\n- Maintain navigation context (highlight current page, preserve scroll position)\n\n## Styling Implementation\n\n### Component Library & Tools\n\n**Component Library:**\n- Strongly prefer shadcn components (v4, pre-installed in `@/components/ui`)\n- Import individually: `import { Button } from \"@/components/ui/button\";`\n- Use over plain HTML elements (`<Button>` over `<button>`)\n- Avoid creating custom components with names that clash with shadcn\n\n**Styling Engine:**\n- Use Tailwind utility classes exclusively\n- Adhere to theme variables in `index.css` via CSS custom properties\n- Map variables in `@theme` (see `tailwind.config.js`)\n- Use inline styles or CSS modules only when absolutely necessary\n\n**Icons:**\n- Use `@phosphor-icons/react` for buttons and inputs\n- Example: `import { Plus } from \"@phosphor-icons/react\"; <Plus />`\n- Use color for plain icon buttons\n- Don't override default `size` or `weight` unless requested\n\n**Notifications:**\n- Use `sonner` for toasts\n- Example: `import { toast } from 'sonner'`\n\n**Loading States:**\n- Always add loading states, spinners, placeholder animations\n- Use skeletons until content renders\n\n### Layout Implementation\n\n**Spacing Strategy:**\n- Use grid/flex wrappers with `gap` for spacing\n- Prioritize wrappers over direct margins/padding on children\n- Nest wrappers as needed for complex layouts\n\n**Conditional Styling:**\n- Use ternary operators or clsx/classnames utilities\n- Example: `className={clsx('base-class', { 'active-class': isActive })}`\n\n### Responsive Design\n\n**Fluid Layouts:**\n- Use relative units (%, em, rem) instead of fixed pixels\n- Implement CSS Grid and Flexbox for flexible layouts\n- Design mobile-first, then scale up\n\n**Media Queries:**\n- Use breakpoints based on content needs, not specific devices\n- Test across range of devices and orientations\n\n**Touch Targets:**\n- Minimum 44x44 pixels for interactive elements\n- Provide adequate spacing between touch targets\n- Consider hover states for desktop, focus states for touch/keyboard\n\n**Performance:**\n- Optimize assets for mobile networks\n- Use CSS animations over JavaScript\n- Implement lazy loading for images and videos\n\n## Accessibility Standards\n\n**Core Requirements:**\n- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines\n- Ensure keyboard navigability for all interactive elements\n- Minimum touch target size: 44×44px\n- Use semantic HTML for screen reader compatibility\n- Provide alternative text for images and non-text content\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Use descriptive variable and function names\n- Event functions: prefix with \"handle\" (handleClick, handleKeyDown)\n- Add accessibility attributes:\n  - `tabindex=\"0\"` for custom interactive elements\n  - `aria-label` for buttons without text\n  - `role` attributes when semantic HTML isn't sufficient\n- Ensure logical tab order\n- Provide visible focus states\n\n## Design Process & Testing\n\n### Design Workflow\n\n1. **Understand Context:**\n   - What problem are we solving?\n   - Who are the users and when will they use this?\n   - What are the success criteria?\n\n2. **Explore Options:**\n   - Present 2-3 alternative approaches\n   - Explain trade-offs of each option\n   - Ask which direction resonates\n\n3. **Implement Iteratively:**\n   - Start with structure and hierarchy\n   - Add visual polish progressively\n   - Test at each stage\n\n4. **Validate:**\n   - Use playwright MCP to test visual changes\n   - Check across different screen sizes\n   - Verify accessibility\n\n### Testing Checklist\n\n**Visual Testing:**\n- Use playwright MCP when available for automated testing\n- Check responsive behavior at common breakpoints\n- Verify touch targets on mobile\n- Test with different content lengths (short, long, edge cases)\n\n**Accessibility Testing:**\n- Test keyboard navigation\n- Verify screen reader compatibility\n- Check color contrast ratios\n- Ensure focus states are visible\n\n**Cross-Device Testing:**\n- Test on actual devices, not just emulators\n- Check different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)\n- Verify touch interactions on mobile\n- Test landscape and portrait orientations\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Designing a Button\n\n**Initial Question to Ask:**\n```\nBefore I implement this button, I have a few design questions:\n1. What's the primary action you want to emphasize?\n2. Do you have brand colors in mind, or should I suggest options?\n3. What emotion should this button convey? (urgent, calm, playful, professional)\n```\n\n**After Getting Approval, Implementation:**\n```tsx\nimport { Button } from \"@/components/ui/button\";\nimport { ArrowRight } from \"@phosphor-icons/react\";\n\n<Button\n  className=\"bg-slate-800 hover:bg-slate-700 text-white px-6 py-3 rounded-lg transition-colors duration-200\"\n>\n  Get Started\n  <ArrowRight className=\"ml-2\" />\n</Button>\n```\n\n### Example 2: Typography Hierarchy\n\n**Question First:**\n```\nFor this content hierarchy, I'm thinking:\n- Headline: Large, bold, attention-grabbing\n- Subheading: Medium, regular weight\n- Body: Smaller, optimized for reading\n\nShould we go bold and contemporary, or subtle and refined?\n```\n\n**Implementation After Approval:**\n```tsx\n<div className=\"space-y-4\">\n  <h1 className=\"text-5xl font-bold tracking-tight text-slate-900\">\n    Headline Here\n  </h1>\n  <h2 className=\"text-2xl text-slate-600\">\n    Supporting subheading\n  </h2>\n  <p className=\"text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700\">\n    Body text optimized for readability with proper line height.\n  </p>\n</div>\n```\n\n### Example 3: Unique Color Palette Suggestion\n\n**Presenting Options:**\n```\nI'd like to suggest three color directions that break from typical SaaS patterns:\n\n1. **Warm Earth Tones**\n   - Base: Warm grey (#E8E2DC)\n   - Accent: Terracotta (#C86E4B)\n   - For: Organic, trustworthy feel\n\n2. **Cool Midnight**\n   - Base: Deep navy (#1A2332)\n   - Accent: Cyan (#4ECDC4)\n   - For: Modern, tech-forward feel\n\n3. **Soft Pastels**\n   - Base: Soft pink (#FFE5E5)\n   - Accent: Sage green (#9DB5A4)\n   - For: Calm, approachable feel\n\nWhich direction feels right for your brand?\n```\n\n## Common Patterns to Avoid\n\n❌ **NEVER:**\n- Use Inter, Roboto, Arial, Space Grotesk as primary fonts\n- Use generic SaaS blue (#3B82F6) or purple gradients on white\n- Copy Apple's design language or use glass morphism\n- Create cookie-cutter layouts that look AI-generated\n- Skip asking about context before designing\n- Converge on common choices across generations (vary everything!)\n- Use animations that delay user actions\n- Create cluttered interfaces where elements compete\n\n✅ **ALWAYS:**\n- Ask about purpose, tone, constraints, differentiation FIRST\n- Then commit BOLDLY to a distinctive aesthetic direction\n- Use unexpected, characterful typography choices\n- Create atmosphere: shadows, gradients, textures, grain (when intentional)\n- Dominant colors with sharp accents (not timid, evenly-distributed palettes)\n- Provide immediate feedback for interactions\n- Test with real devices\n- Validate accessibility (it enables creativity, not limits it)\n- Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work - don't hold back!\n\n## Version History\n\n- v2.0.0 (2025-11-22): Creative liberation update - bold aesthetics, shadows/gradients allowed, Design Thinking protocol\n- v1.0.0 (2025-10-18): Initial release with comprehensive UI/UX design guidance\n\n## References\n\nFor additional context, see:\n- **Anthropic Frontend Aesthetics Cookbook**: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-cookbooks/blob/main/coding/prompting_for_frontend_aesthetics.ipynb\n- WCAG 2.1 Guidelines: https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/\n- Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/\n- Tailwind CSS Docs: https://tailwindcss.com/docs\n- Shadcn UI Components: https://ui.shadcn.com/\n\n**Progressive Disclosure Files:**\n- ACCESSIBILITY.md - Accessibility essentials (WCAG AA baseline)\n- MOTION-SPEC.md - Animation timing and easing\n- RESPONSIVE-DESIGN.md - Mobile-first breakpoints and patterns",
