  "description": "# File Organizer\n\nThis skill acts as your personal organization assistant, helping you maintain a clean, logical file structure across your computer without the mental overhead of constant manual organization.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\n- Your Downloads folder is a chaotic mess\n- You can't find files because they're scattered everywhere\n- You have duplicate files taking up space\n- Your folder structure doesn't make sense anymore\n- You want to establish better organization habits\n- You're starting a new project and need a good structure\n- You're cleaning up before archiving old projects\n\n## What This Skill Does\n\n1. **Analyzes Current Structure**: Reviews your folders and files to understand what you have\n2. **Finds Duplicates**: Identifies duplicate files across your system\n3. **Suggests Organization**: Proposes logical folder structures based on your content\n4. **Automates Cleanup**: Moves, renames, and organizes files with your approval\n5. **Maintains Context**: Makes smart decisions based on file types, dates, and content\n6. **Reduces Clutter**: Identifies old files you probably don't need anymore\n\n## How to Use\n\n### From Your Home Directory\n\n```\ncd ~\n```\n\nThen run Claude Code and ask for help:\n\n```\nHelp me organize my Downloads folder\n```\n\n```\nFind duplicate files in my Documents folder\n```\n\n```\nReview my project directories and suggest improvements\n```\n\n### Specific Organization Tasks\n\n```\nOrganize these downloads into proper folders based on what they are\n```\n\n```\nFind duplicate files and help me decide which to keep\n```\n\n```\nClean up old files I haven't touched in 6+ months\n```\n\n```\nCreate a better folder structure for my [work/projects/photos/etc]\n```\n\n## Instructions\n\nWhen a user requests file organization help:\n\n1. **Understand the Scope**\n   \n   Ask clarifying questions:\n   - Which directory needs organization? (Downloads, Documents, entire home folder?)\n   - What's the main problem? (Can't find things, duplicates, too messy, no structure?)\n   - Any files or folders to avoid? (Current projects, sensitive data?)\n   - How aggressively to organize? (Conservative vs. comprehensive cleanup)\n\n2. **Analyze Current State**\n   \n   Review the target directory:\n   ```bash\n   # Get overview of current structure\n   ls -la [target_directory]\n   \n   # Check file types and sizes\n   find [target_directory] -type f -exec file {} \\; | head -20\n   \n   # Identify largest files\n   du -sh [target_directory]/* | sort -rh | head -20\n   \n   # Count file types\n   find [target_directory] -type f | sed 's/.*\\.//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn\n   ```\n   \n   Summarize findings:\n   - Total files and folders\n   - File type breakdown\n   - Size distribution\n   - Date ranges\n   - Obvious organization issues\n\n3. **Identify Organization Patterns**\n   \n   Based on the files, determine logical groupings:\n   \n   **By Type**:\n   - Documents (PDFs, DOCX, TXT)\n   - Images (JPG, PNG, SVG)\n   - Videos (MP4, MOV)\n   - Archives (ZIP, TAR, DMG)\n   - Code/Projects (directories with code)\n   - Spreadsheets (XLSX, CSV)\n   - Presentations (PPTX, KEY)\n   \n   **By Purpose**:\n   - Work vs. Personal\n   - Active vs. Archive\n   - Project-specific\n   - Reference materials\n   - Temporary/scratch files\n   \n   **By Date**:\n   - Current year/month\n   - Previous years\n   - Very old (archive candidates)\n\n4. **Find Duplicates**\n   \n   When requested, search for duplicates:\n   ```bash\n   # Find exact duplicates by hash\n   find [directory] -type f -exec md5 {} \\; | sort | uniq -d\n   \n   # Find files with same name\n   find [directory] -type f -printf '%f\\n' | sort | uniq -d\n   \n   # Find similar-sized files\n   find [directory] -type f -printf '%s %p\\n' | sort -n\n   ```\n   \n   For each set of duplicates:\n   - Show all file paths\n   - Display sizes and modification dates\n   - Recommend which to keep (usually newest or best-named)\n   - **Important**: Always ask for confirmation before deleting\n\n5. **Propose Organization Plan**\n   \n   Present a clear plan before making changes:\n   \n   ```markdown\n   # Organization Plan for [Directory]\n   \n   ## Current State\n   - X files across Y folders\n   - [Size] total\n   - File types: [breakdown]\n   - Issues: [list problems]\n   \n   ## Proposed Structure\n   \n   ```\n   [Directory]/\n   ├── Work/\n   │   ├── Projects/\n   │   ├── Documents/\n   │   └── Archive/\n   ├── Personal/\n   │   ├── Photos/\n   │   ├── Documents/\n   │   └── Media/\n   └── Downloads/\n       ├── To-Sort/\n       └── Archive/\n   ```\n   \n   ## Changes I'll Make\n   \n   1. **Create new folders**: [list]\n   2. **Move files**:\n      - X PDFs → Work/Documents/\n      - Y images → Personal/Photos/\n      - Z old files → Archive/\n   3. **Rename files**: [any renaming patterns]\n   4. **Delete**: [duplicates or trash files]\n   \n   ## Files Needing Your Decision\n   \n   - [List any files you're unsure about]\n   \n   Ready to proceed? (yes/no/modify)\n   ```\n\n6. **Execute Organization**\n   \n   After approval, organize systematically:\n   \n   ```bash\n   # Create folder structure\n   mkdir -p \"path/to/new/folders\"\n   \n   # Move files with clear logging\n   mv \"old/path/file.pdf\" \"new/path/file.pdf\"\n   \n   # Rename files with consistent patterns\n   # Example: \"YYYY-MM-DD - Description.ext\"\n   ```\n   \n   **Important Rules**:\n   - Always confirm before deleting anything\n   - Log all moves for potential undo\n   - Preserve original modification dates\n   - Handle filename conflicts gracefully\n   - Stop and ask if you encounter unexpected situations\n\n7. **Provide Summary and Maintenance Tips**\n   \n   After organizing:\n   \n   ```markdown\n   # Organization Complete! ✨\n   \n   ## What Changed\n   \n   - Created [X] new folders\n   - Organized [Y] files\n   - Freed [Z] GB by removing duplicates\n   - Archived [W] old files\n   \n   ## New Structure\n   \n   [Show the new folder tree]\n   \n   ## Maintenance Tips\n   \n   To keep this organized:\n   \n   1. **Weekly**: Sort new downloads\n   2. **Monthly**: Review and archive completed projects\n   3. **Quarterly**: Check for new duplicates\n   4. **Yearly**: Archive old files\n   \n   ## Quick Commands for You\n   \n   ```bash\n   # Find files modified this week\n   find . -type f -mtime -7\n   \n   # Sort downloads by type\n   [custom command for their setup]\n   \n   # Find duplicates\n   [custom command]\n   ```\n   \n   Want to organize another folder?\n   ```\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Organizing Downloads (From Justin Dielmann)\n\n**User**: \"My Downloads folder is a mess with 500+ files. Help me organize it.\"\n\n**Process**:\n1. Analyzes Downloads folder\n2. Finds patterns: work docs, personal photos, installers, random PDFs\n3. Proposes structure:\n   - Downloads/\n     - Work/\n     - Personal/\n     - Installers/ (DMG, PKG files)\n     - Archive/\n     - ToSort/ (things needing decisions)\n4. Asks for confirmation\n5. Moves files intelligently based on content and names\n6. Results: 500 files → 5 organized folders\n\n### Example 2: Finding and Removing Duplicates\n\n**User**: \"Find duplicate files in my Documents and help me decide which to keep.\"\n\n**Output**:\n```markdown\n# Found 23 Sets of Duplicates (156 MB total)\n\n## Duplicate Set 1: \"proposal.pdf\"\n- `/Documents/proposal.pdf` (2.3 MB, modified: 2024-03-15)\n- `/Documents/old/proposal.pdf` (2.3 MB, modified: 2024-03-15)\n- `/Desktop/proposal.pdf` (2.3 MB, modified: 2024-03-10)\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep `/Documents/proposal.pdf` (most recent in correct location)\nDelete the other 2 copies?\n\n[Continue for all duplicates...]\n```\n\n### Example 3: Restructuring Projects Folder\n\n**User**: \"Review my ~/Projects directory and suggest improvements.\"\n\n**Output**:\n```markdown\n# Analysis of ~/Projects\n\n## Current Structure Issues\n- Mix of active and archived projects (3+ years old)\n- No consistent naming convention\n- Some projects at root, others in random subfolders\n- Duplicate folders (project-name, project-name-old, project-name-v2)\n\n## Proposed Structure\n\n```\nProjects/\n├── Active/\n│   ├── client-work/\n│   ├── side-projects/\n│   └── learning/\n├── Archive/\n│   ├── 2022/\n│   ├── 2023/\n│   └── 2024/\n└── Templates/\n```\n\n## Specific Changes\n1. Move 12 projects not touched since 2022 → Archive/\n2. Consolidate 4 duplicate project folders\n3. Rename projects to consistent format: \"client-name-project-name\"\n4. Create Archive for old work\n\nWant me to implement this?\n```\n\n### Example 4: Organizing Photos by Date\n\n**User**: \"Organize my photo folders by year and month.\"\n\n**Output**: Creates structure like:\n```\nPhotos/\n├── 2023/\n│   ├── 01-January/\n│   ├── 02-February/\n│   └── ...\n├── 2024/\n│   ├── 01-January/\n│   └── ...\n└── Unsorted/\n```\n\nThen moves photos based on EXIF data or file modification dates.\n\n## Common Organization Tasks\n\n### Downloads Cleanup\n```\nOrganize my Downloads folder - move documents to Documents, \nimages to Pictures, keep installers separate, and archive files \nolder than 3 months.\n```\n\n### Project Organization\n```\nReview my Projects folder structure and help me separate active \nprojects from old ones I should archive.\n```\n\n### Duplicate Removal\n```\nFind all duplicate files in my Documents folder and help me \ndecide which ones to keep.\n```\n\n### Desktop Cleanup\n```\nMy Desktop is covered in files. Help me organize everything into \nmy Documents folder properly.\n```\n\n### Photo Organization\n```\nOrganize all photos in this folder by date (year/month) based \non when they were taken.\n```\n\n### Work/Personal Separation\n```\nHelp me separate my work files from personal files across my \nDocuments folder.\n```\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n1. **Start Small**: Begin with one messy folder (like Downloads) to build trust\n2. **Regular Maintenance**: Run weekly cleanup on Downloads\n3. **Consistent Naming**: Use \"YYYY-MM-DD - Description\" format for important files\n4. **Archive Aggressively**: Move old projects to Archive instead of deleting\n5. **Keep Active Separate**: Maintain clear boundaries between active and archived work\n6. **Trust the Process**: Let Claude handle the cognitive load of where things go\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Folder Naming\n- Use clear, descriptive names\n- Avoid spaces (use hyphens or underscores)\n- Be specific: \"client-proposals\" not \"docs\"\n- Use prefixes for ordering: \"01-current\", \"02-archive\"\n\n### File Naming\n- Include dates: \"2024-10-17-meeting-notes.md\"\n- Be descriptive: \"q3-financial-report.xlsx\"\n- Avoid version numbers in names (use version control instead)\n- Remove download artifacts: \"document-final-v2 (1).pdf\" → \"document.pdf\"\n\n### When to Archive\n- Projects not touched in 6+ months\n- Completed work that might be referenced later\n- Old versions after migration to new systems\n- Files you're hesitant to delete (archive first)\n\n## Related Use Cases\n\n- Setting up organization for a new computer\n- Preparing files for backup/archiving\n- Cleaning up before storage cleanup\n- Organizing shared team folders\n- Structuring new project directories",
