Help me create an outline.\"\n\n**Process**:\n1. Collaborates on outline structure\n2. Identifies research needs\n3. User starts writing introduction\n4. Reviews and improves the hook\n5. User writes each section\n6. Provides feedback after each section\n7. Conducts research and adds citations\n8. Final review of complete draft\n9. Polish and prep for publishing\n\n**Result**: Well-researched, properly cited article written in Teresa's voice with strong structure and flow.\n\n### Example 2: Research-Heavy Article\n\n**User**: \"I'm writing about AI's impact on product management. Help me find current data and examples.\"\n\n**Output**:\n```markdown\n## Research Compiled\n\n### Recent Data\n- Gartner: 80% of PMs will use AI tools by 2025 [1]\n- Survey: 45% report faster feature shipping [2]\n- Case study: Airbnb's AI-assisted prioritization [3]\n\n### Expert Quotes\n- \"AI amplifies PM judgment, not replaces it\" - Marty Cagan\n- [Additional quotes with citations]\n\n### Real Examples\n1. **Company A**: Used AI for user research synthesis\n   - Result: 60% time savings\n   - Source: [citation]\n\n2. **Company B**: AI-powered roadmap analysis\n   - Result: Better stakeholder alignment\n   - Source: [citation]\n\nAll added to your outline with proper citations.\n```\n\n### Example 3: Hook Improvement\n\n**User's Original Hook**:\n> \"Product management is changing because of AI. In this article, I'll discuss some ways AI affects product managers.\"\n\n**Improved Options**:\n\n**Option 1 (Data-driven)**:\n> \"Last month, I asked AI to analyze 500 customer interviews. It took 30 minutes instead of 3 weeks. Product management will never be the same.\"\n\n**Option 2 (Question)**:\n> \"What if you could talk to every customer, read every review, and analyze every support ticket—all before your morning coffee?\"\n\n**Option 3 (Story)**:\n> \"Sarah spent two weeks building the wrong feature. Not because she didn't understand her users, but because she couldn't process the hundreds of interviews fast enough to spot the pattern.\"\n\n### Example 4: Section Feedback\n\n**User**: \"Just finished my 'Common Mistakes' section. Thoughts?\"\n\n**Response**:\n```markdown\n# Feedback: Common Mistakes Section\n\n## What Works Well ✓\n- Strong examples (the Slack notification story)\n- Clear structure (3 mistakes, clean layout)\n- Practical advice for each mistake\n\n## Suggestions\n\n### Make It More Specific\nYour second point says \"Bad prioritization\" but could be stronger:\n\nCurrent:\n> \"Many teams prioritize badly by focusing on features instead of outcomes.\"\n\nSuggested:\n> \"I've watched teams ship 14 features in a quarter yet move none of their key metrics. They prioritized activity over progress.\"\n\n### Add Data\nThe third mistake would benefit from evidence:\n> \"[Add citation]: Studies show teams without regular user contact are 3x more likely to build unused features [needs source]\"\n\n### Flow Improvement\nConsider reordering: Mistake 3 → Mistake 2 → Mistake 1\nThis builds from small to big impact.\n\nReady for the next section!\n```\n\n## Writing Workflows\n\n### Blog Post Workflow\n1.
