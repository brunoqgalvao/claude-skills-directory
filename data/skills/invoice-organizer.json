  "description": "# Invoice Organizer\n\nThis skill transforms chaotic folders of invoices, receipts, and financial documents into a clean, tax-ready filing system without manual effort.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\n- Preparing for tax season and need organized records\n- Managing business expenses across multiple vendors\n- Organizing receipts from a messy folder or email downloads\n- Setting up automated invoice filing for ongoing bookkeeping\n- Archiving financial records by year or category\n- Reconciling expenses for reimbursement\n- Preparing documentation for accountants\n\n## What This Skill Does\n\n1. **Reads Invoice Content**: Extracts information from PDFs, images, and documents:\n   - Vendor/company name\n   - Invoice number\n   - Date\n   - Amount\n   - Product or service description\n   - Payment method\n\n2. **Renames Files Consistently**: Creates standardized filenames:\n   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD Vendor - Invoice - ProductOrService.pdf`\n   - Examples: `2024-03-15 Adobe - Invoice - Creative Cloud.pdf`\n\n3. **Organizes by Category**: Sorts into logical folders:\n   - By vendor\n   - By expense category (software, office, travel, etc.)\n   - By time period (year, quarter, month)\n   - By tax category (deductible, personal, etc.)\n\n4. **Handles Multiple Formats**: Works with:\n   - PDF invoices\n   - Scanned receipts (JPG, PNG)\n   - Email attachments\n   - Screenshots\n   - Bank statements\n\n5. **Maintains Originals**: Preserves original files while organizing copies\n\n## How to Use\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nNavigate to your messy invoice folder:\n```\ncd ~/Desktop/receipts-to-sort\n```\n\nThen ask Claude Code:\n```\nOrganize these invoices for taxes\n```\n\nOr more specifically:\n```\nRead all invoices in this folder, rename them to \n\"YYYY-MM-DD Vendor - Invoice - Product.pdf\" format, \nand organize them by vendor\n```\n\n### Advanced Organization\n\n```\nOrganize these invoices:\n1. Extract date, vendor, and description from each file\n2. Rename to standard format\n3. Sort into folders by expense category (Software, Office, Travel, etc.)\n4. Create a CSV spreadsheet with all invoice details for my accountant\n```\n\n## Instructions\n\nWhen a user requests invoice organization:\n\n1. **Scan the Folder**\n   \n   Identify all invoice files:\n   ```bash\n   # Find all invoice-related files\n   find . -type f \\( -name \"*.pdf\" -o -name \"*.jpg\" -o -name \"*.png\" \\) -print\n   ```\n   \n   Report findings:\n   - Total number of files\n   - File types\n   - Date range (if discernible from names)\n   - Current organization (or lack thereof)\n\n2. **Extract Information from Each File**\n   \n   For each invoice, extract:\n   \n   **From PDF invoices**:\n   - Use text extraction to read invoice content\n   - Look for common patterns:\n     - \"Invoice Date:\", \"Date:\", \"Issued:\"\n     - \"Invoice #:\", \"Invoice Number:\"\n     - Company name (usually at top)\n     - \"Amount Due:\", \"Total:\", \"Amount:\"\n     - \"Description:\", \"Service:\", \"Product:\"\n   \n   **From image receipts**:\n   - Read visible text from images\n   - Identify vendor name (often at top)\n   - Look for date (common formats)\n   - Find total amount\n   \n   **Fallback for unclear files**:\n   - Use filename clues\n   - Check file creation/modification date\n   - Flag for manual review if critical info missing\n\n3. **Determine Organization Strategy**\n   \n   Ask user preference if not specified:\n   \n   ```markdown\n   I found [X] invoices from [date range].\n   \n   How would you like them organized?\n   \n   1. **By Vendor** (Adobe/, Amazon/, Stripe/, etc.)\n   2. **By Category** (Software/, Office Supplies/, Travel/, etc.)\n   3. **By Date** (2024/Q1/, 2024/Q2/, etc.)\n   4. **By Tax Category** (Deductible/, Personal/, etc.)\n   5. **Custom** (describe your structure)\n   \n   Or I can use a default structure: Year/Category/Vendor\n   ```\n\n4. **Create Standardized Filename**\n   \n   For each invoice, create a filename following this pattern:\n   \n   ```\n   YYYY-MM-DD Vendor - Invoice - Description.ext\n   ```\n   \n   Examples:\n   - `2024-03-15 Adobe - Invoice - Creative Cloud.pdf`\n   - `2024-01-10 Amazon - Receipt - Office Supplies.pdf`\n   - `2023-12-01 Stripe - Invoice - Monthly Payment Processing.pdf`\n   \n   **Filename Best Practices**:\n   - Remove special characters except hyphens\n   - Capitalize vendor names properly\n   - Keep descriptions concise but meaningful\n   - Use consistent date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for sorting\n   - Preserve original file extension\n\n5. **Execute Organization**\n   \n   Before moving files, show the plan:\n   \n   ```markdown\n   # Organization Plan\n   \n   ## Proposed Structure\n   ```\n   Invoices/\n   ├── 2023/\n   │   ├── Software/\n   │   │   ├── Adobe/\n   │   │   └── Microsoft/\n   │   ├── Services/\n   │   └── Office/\n   └── 2024/\n       ├── Software/\n       ├── Services/\n       └── Office/\n   ```\n   \n   ## Sample Changes\n   \n   Before: `invoice_adobe_march.pdf`\n   After: `2024-03-15 Adobe - Invoice - Creative Cloud.pdf`\n   Location: `Invoices/2024/Software/Adobe/`\n   \n   Before: `IMG_2847.jpg`\n   After: `2024-02-10 Staples - Receipt - Office Supplies.jpg`\n   Location: `Invoices/2024/Office/Staples/`\n   \n   Process [X] files? (yes/no)\n   ```\n   \n   After approval:\n   ```bash\n   # Create folder structure\n   mkdir -p \"Invoices/2024/Software/Adobe\"\n   \n   # Copy (don't move) to preserve originals\n   cp \"original.pdf\" \"Invoices/2024/Software/Adobe/2024-03-15 Adobe - Invoice - Creative Cloud.pdf\"\n   \n   # Or move if user prefers\n   mv \"original.pdf\" \"new/path/standardized-name.pdf\"\n   ```\n\n6. **Generate Summary Report**\n   \n   Create a CSV file with all invoice details:\n   \n   ```csv\n   Date,Vendor,Invoice Number,Description,Amount,Category,File Path\n   2024-03-15,Adobe,INV-12345,Creative Cloud,52.99,Software,Invoices/2024/Software/Adobe/2024-03-15 Adobe - Invoice - Creative Cloud.pdf\n   2024-03-10,Amazon,123-4567890-1234567,Office Supplies,127.45,Office,Invoices/2024/Office/Amazon/2024-03-10 Amazon - Receipt - Office Supplies.pdf\n   ...\n   ```\n   \n   This CSV is useful for:\n   - Importing into accounting software\n   - Sharing with accountants\n   - Expense tracking and reporting\n   - Tax preparation\n\n7. **Provide Completion Summary**\n   \n   ```markdown\n   # Organization Complete! 📊\n   \n   ## Summary\n   - **Processed**: [X] invoices\n   - **Date range**: [earliest] to [latest]\n   - **Total amount**: $[sum] (if amounts extracted)\n   - **Vendors**: [Y] unique vendors\n   \n   ## New Structure\n   ```\n   Invoices/\n   ├── 2024/ (45 files)\n   │   ├── Software/ (23 files)\n   │   ├── Services/ (12 files)\n   │   └── Office/ (10 files)\n   └── 2023/ (12 files)\n   ```\n   \n   ## Files Created\n   - `/Invoices/` - Organized invoices\n   - `/Invoices/invoice-summary.csv` - Spreadsheet for accounting\n   - `/Invoices/originals/` - Original files (if copied)\n   \n   ## Files Needing Review\n   [List any files where information couldn't be extracted completely]\n   \n   ## Next Steps\n   1. Review the `invoice-summary.csv` file\n   2. Check files in \"Needs Review\" folder\n   3. Import CSV into your accounting software\n   4. Set up auto-organization for future invoices\n   \n   Ready for tax season! 🎉\n   ```\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Tax Preparation (From Martin Merschroth)\n\n**User**: \"I have a messy folder of invoices for taxes. Sort them and rename properly.\"\n\n**Process**:\n1. Scans folder: finds 147 PDFs and images\n2. Reads each invoice to extract:\n   - Date\n   - Vendor name\n   - Invoice number\n   - Product/service description\n3. Renames all files: `YYYY-MM-DD Vendor - Invoice - Product.pdf`\n4. Organizes into: `2024/Software/`, `2024/Travel/`, etc.\n5. Creates `invoice-summary.csv` for accountant\n6. Result: Tax-ready organized invoices in minutes\n\n### Example 2: Monthly Expense Reconciliation\n\n**User**: \"Organize my business receipts from last month by category.\"\n\n**Output**:\n```markdown\n# March 2024 Receipts Organized\n\n## By Category\n- Software & Tools: $847.32 (12 invoices)\n- Office Supplies: $234.18 (8 receipts)\n- Travel & Meals: $1,456.90 (15 receipts)\n- Professional Services: $2,500.00 (3 invoices)\n\nTotal: $5,038.40\n\nAll receipts renamed and filed in:\n`Business-Receipts/2024/03-March/[Category]/`\n\nCSV export: `march-2024-expenses.csv`\n```\n\n### Example 3: Multi-Year Archive\n\n**User**: \"I have 3 years of random invoices. Organize them by year, then by vendor.\"\n\n**Output**: Creates structure:\n```\nInvoices/\n├── 2022/\n│   ├── Adobe/\n│   ├── Amazon/\n│   └── ...\n├── 2023/\n│   ├── Adobe/\n│   ├── Amazon/\n│   └── ...\n└── 2024/\n    ├── Adobe/\n    ├── Amazon/\n    └── ...\n```\n\nEach file properly renamed with date and description.\n\n### Example 4: Email Downloads Cleanup\n\n**User**: \"I download invoices from Gmail. They're all named 'invoice.pdf', 'invoice(1).pdf', etc. Fix this mess.\"\n\n**Output**:\n```markdown\nFound 89 files all named \"invoice*.pdf\"\n\nReading each file to extract real information...\n\nRenamed examples:\n- invoice.pdf → 2024-03-15 Shopify - Invoice - Monthly Subscription.pdf\n- invoice(1).pdf → 2024-03-14 Google - Invoice - Workspace.pdf\n- invoice(2).pdf → 2024-03-10 Netlify - Invoice - Pro Plan.pdf\n\nAll files renamed and organized by vendor.\n```\n\n## Common Organization Patterns\n\n### By Vendor (Simple)\n```\nInvoices/\n├── Adobe/\n├── Amazon/\n├── Google/\n└── Microsoft/\n```\n\n### By Year and Category (Tax-Friendly)\n```\nInvoices/\n├── 2023/\n│   ├── Software/\n│   ├── Hardware/\n│   ├── Services/\n│   └── Travel/\n└── 2024/\n    └── ...\n```\n\n### By Quarter (Detailed Tracking)\n```\nInvoices/\n├── 2024/\n│   ├── Q1/\n│   │   ├── Software/\n│   │   ├── Office/\n│   │   └── Travel/\n│   └── Q2/\n│       └── ...\n```\n\n### By Tax Category (Accountant-Ready)\n```\nInvoices/\n├── Deductible/\n│   ├── Software/\n│   ├── Office/\n│   └── Professional-Services/\n├── Partially-Deductible/\n│   └── Meals-Travel/\n└── Personal/\n```\n\n## Automation Setup\n\nFor ongoing organization:\n\n```\nCreate a script that watches my ~/Downloads/invoices folder \nand auto-organizes any new invoice files using our standard \nnaming and folder structure.\n```\n\nThis creates a persistent solution that organizes invoices as they arrive.\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n1. **Scan emails to PDF**: Use Preview or similar to save email invoices as PDFs first\n2. **Consistent downloads**: Save all invoices to one folder for batch processing\n3. **Monthly routine**: Organize invoices monthly, not annually\n4. **Backup originals**: Keep original files before reorganizing\n5. **Include amounts in CSV**: Useful for budget tracking\n6. **Tag by deductibility**: Note which expenses are tax-deductible\n7. **Keep receipts 7 years**: Standard audit period\n\n## Handling Special Cases\n\n### Missing Information\nIf date/vendor can't be extracted:\n- Flag file for manual review\n- Use file modification date as fallback\n- Create \"Needs-Review/\" folder\n\n### Duplicate Invoices\nIf same invoice appears multiple times:\n- Compare file hashes\n- Keep highest quality version\n- Note duplicates in summary\n\n### Multi-Page Invoices\nFor invoices split across files:\n- Merge PDFs if needed\n- Use consistent naming for parts\n- Note in CSV if invoice is split\n\n### Non-Standard Formats\nFor unusual receipt formats:\n- Extract what's possible\n- Standardize what you can\n- Flag for review if critical info missing\n\n## Related Use Cases\n\n- Creating expense reports for reimbursement\n- Organizing bank statements\n- Managing vendor contracts\n- Archiving old financial records\n- Preparing for audits\n- Tracking subscription costs over time",
